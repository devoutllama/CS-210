Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this course, I will be using Project 3. The project required us to create code to track items for a grocer/grocery store. The program took/read data from a file, organized it, and put it into a different file. With the new file, we could store items and the frequency of their purchases. This would help the store optimize its sales and track certain items better. The code had several options to perform specific actions, including a histogram to visually display items and their frequencies.

What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did particularly well was print the menu. To do this well, I had to make sure that the functions I called in the menu function worked well, or to some degree. For example, the most essential function in the program (GetFrequencyDataFromFile()). This function was the backbone of the rest of the functions. If it didn't work correctly, most of what I would have to do would be much more challenging. I created a vector to store item data, which was then added to as data was being read from the file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Going off my past two projects, my code organization and readability needed work. There were only a few comments in the first two, which I had to look out for when I began the project. Writing code to be easily readable and modifiable would do a world of good. Also, all my code was in a singular file for this project. Putting function definitions in a different file would have been a better thing to do, as this would allow anyone who stumbled upon my work to make changes where needed quickly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the program for me was the GetFrequencyDataFromFile() function. It was the most crucial function as almost everything in some part led back to it. It was pretty easy to write in the end. It only provided some degree of worrying, particularly in writing data into the .dat file. There was a lot of back and forth between the notes and content to ensure I was doing the right thing and using the correct syntax. In the end, they helped, and it came out generally okay. The Zybooks examples provided a good guide into ways I could go about the tasks I was presented with.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
As with all programming languages, the way objects are used is essential. My vector object stored data and put it into the file, while my structure/structure object held the current item data being read from the file.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The comments were the heart and soul of the program. It allowed me, the programmer, to navigate my functions and remember what specific things did. The use of comments followed industry-standard practices, enabling others apart from myself to navigate/follow the code easily. The use of functions also streamlined the program itself.
